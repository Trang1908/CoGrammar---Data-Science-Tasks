# Provide pseudo code for this problem
# Request the name input from a user, restore into variable called name, and print it out
# Request the age input from that user, restore into variable called age, and print it out
# Print the string "Hello World!" on a new line

# Write Python code to take in a user's name using input() and then print out the name
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)
print()

# Use the same input and output approach to take in a user's age and print it out
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print(age)
print()

# Print the string "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!")
