## hello_world.py
- write Python code to take in a user's name using input() and then print out the name.
- Use the same input and output approach to take in a user's age and print it out.
- Finally, print the string "Hello World!" on a new line (the new line will happen by default if you use a separate print statement to the one you used immediately above to print out the age,
because each print statement automatically inserts an "enter", or newline instruction, at the end).

## details.py
Use an input() command to get the following information from the user.
- Name
- Age
- House number
- Street name

Print out a single sentence containing all the details of the user.
For example:
This is John Smith. He is 28 years old and lives at house number 42 on Hamilton Street.

## conversion.py
Declare the following variables:
- num1 = 99.23
- num2 = 23
- num3 = 150
- string1 = "100"

Convert them as follows:
- num1 into an integer
- num2 into a float
- num3 into a String
- string1 into an integer

Print out all the variables on separate lines
