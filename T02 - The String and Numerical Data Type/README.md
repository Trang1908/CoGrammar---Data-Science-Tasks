# replace.py
- Save the sentence: "The!quick!brown!fox!jumps!over!the!lazy!dog." as a single string.
- Reprint this sentence as "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." using the replace() function to replace every "!" exclamation mark with a blank space.
- Reprint that sentence as: "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG." using the upper() function.
- Print the sentence in reverse. (Hint: review what you learned about slicing!)

# manipulation.py
- Ask the user to enter a sentence using the input() method. Save the user's response in a variable called str_manip.
- Using this string value, write the code to do the following:
  + Calculate and display the length of str_manip.
  + Find the last letter in str_manip sentence. Replace every occurrence of this letter in str_manip with "@".
    e.g. if str_manip = "This is a bunch of words", the output would be: "Thi@ i@ a bunch of word@".
- Print the last 3 characters in str_manip backwards.
    e.g. if str_manip = "This is a bunch of words", the output would be: "sdr".
- Create a five-letter word that is made up of the first three characters and the last two characters in str_manip.
    e.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of words”, the output would be: "Thids".

# numbers.py
Ask the user to enter three different integers.

Then print out:
- The sum of all the numbers
- The first number minus the second number
- The third number multiplied by the first number
- The sum of all three numbers divided by the third number

# challenge_1.py
- Ask the user to enter the lengths of all three sides of a triangle.
- Calculate the area of the triangle.
- Print out the area.

  Hints:
- If side1, side2 and side3 are the sides of the triangle:
- s = (side1 + side2 + side3)/2 and
- area = √(s(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
- You’ll need to be able to calculate the square root

# challenge_2.py
- Write Python code to take the name of a user's favourite restaurant and store it in a variable called string_fav.
- Below this, write a statement to take in the user's favourite number. Use
casting to store it in an integer variable called int_fav.
- Print out both of these using two separate print statements below what you have written. Be careful!
- Once this is working, try to cast string_fav to an integer. What happens?
- Add a comment in your code to explain why this is.
